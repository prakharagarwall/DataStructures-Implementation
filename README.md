# DataStructures-Implementation
Here you will find various competitive programming solutions, implemented with efficient memory and run-time.
Most of the implementations here are with only the main logic of the solutions. You can look for the type of input and the output by simply looking up to the definition of the function.
I am just a guy trying to improve my coding and data structures implementation skills during my free time in summer, I know most of the people around the world has better solutions then each and every solution I have done here.
If you come around a better solution or memory efficient then any of them, then feel free to contact me at PRAKHARAGARWALL95@GMAIL.COM.
Happy Coding. I am always there if you need any help, just send me an email.
