// Initially on a notepad only one character 'A' is present. You can perform two operations on this notepad for each step:
//Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the notepad (partial copy is not allowed).
//Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.
//Given a number n. You have to get exactly n 'A' on the notepad by performing the minimum number of steps permitted. 
//Output the minimum number of steps to get n 'A'.

//Example:
//Input: 3
//Output: 3
//Explanation:
//Intitally, we have one character 'A'.
//In step 1, we use Copy All operation.
//In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.
//In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'.

//Here for each value of d from 2, i am check whether is it possible to paste and minimise the number of operations using the d number of A,
if it is not then we increase the value of d.
